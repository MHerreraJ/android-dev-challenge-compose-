## :scroll: Description
This application takes advantage of the JetPack Compose toolkit, allowing to create native Android UI's.
The app is a puppy-adoption interface, where is listed a list of puppies, and showing a detailed screen with the puppy attributes, by clicking the list item.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
One of my friends informed me of the challenge that Android was organizing to use its Jetpack Compose toolkit, after further research I discovered that it was an innovative proposal to build graphical interfaces in a faster way and that it would require less maintenance.

I'm specially proud that in less than 5 hours, I developed the complete challenge, starting from 0 knowledge of the Jetpack Compose toolkit.
